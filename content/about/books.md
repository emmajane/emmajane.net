In 2014 I released a set of videos with O'Reilly: Collaborating with Git. The companion book, Git for Teams, was released September 2015 and is a best seller. My previous books (Drupal User's Guide; and Front End Drupal) and videos (Drupal Fundamentals) were published with Prentice Hall.

With contributions in Jono Bacon's Linux Desktop Hacks, Earl and Lynette Miles' Drupal's Building Blocks, and Shannon Okey's knitting pattern book Alt Fiber, you might say I have a rather diverse (but technical) set of interests. I make an appearance in The Yarn Harlot's book Knitting Rules! for my sweater disaster. I occasionally write for magazines such as Linux Pro Magazine, Drupal Watchdog, and Mosaic. You can read an interview with me in which I talk about the cross-over between my craft and tech worlds.

I'm (tentatively) working on a fourth book on running and navigation.
