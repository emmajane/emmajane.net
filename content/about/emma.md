Hi! I'm an expat Canadian living and working on Dartmoor in the UK. During the day I manage the Web operations team for the Digital Services team at the <a href="http://www.unocha.org">Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs at the United Nations</a>.

Previously, I've worked for <a href="https://www.phase2technology.com">Phase2</a>, and <a href="http://lullabot.com">Lullabot</a>. I've taught Web technologies at both <a href="http://www.senecac.on.ca">Seneca College</a> and <a href="http://www.humber.ca/">Humber College</a>. I have delivered presentations at conferences across North America, Europe, and New Zealand. My conference presentations have addressed topics that are both "technical" (database migration, source control, Drupal, front end development) and "social" (empathy, women in computing, community building).

Over the years I've been involved with several technology projects including <a href="http://tldp.org/ldpwn/20040414.html#interview">The Linux Documentation Project</a> and acted as a standards advocate with the <a href="http://www.webstandards.org/about/members/ejhogbin/">Web Standards Project</a>. Along with Gabrielle Roth, I coined "The Unicorn Law" which states "If you are a woman in open source, you will eventually give a talk about being a woman in open source."</p>

I've written two books on Drupal (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0137136692/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ht073-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=0137136692">Front End Drupal</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0137041292/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ht073-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=0137041292">Drupal User's Guide</a>). My third book, <a href="http://gitforteams.com">Git for Teams</a>, has been a best selling title for O'Reilly. I have contributions in Jono Bacon's <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/linuxdeskhks/">Linux Desktop Hacks</a>, Earl and Lynette Miles' <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321591313/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ht073-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=0321591313">Drupal's Building Blocks</a>, and Shannon Okey's knitting pattern book<a href="http://www.amazon.ca/Alt-Fiber-Projects-Knitting-Bamboo/dp/1580089151/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1205434073&amp;sr=8-7" style="line-height: 20px;">Alt Fiber</a>. I make an appearance in <a href="http://www.yarnharlot.ca">The Yarn Harlot</a>'s book Knitting Rules! for <a href="http://www.yarnharlot.ca/blog/archives/2005/11/03/dear_teresa.html">my sweater disaster</a>.

I occasionally write for magazines such as <a href="http://www.linuxpromagazine.com/">Linux Pro Magazine</a>, <a href="http://drupalwatchdog.com/">Drupal Watchdog</a>, and <a href="http://greybrucemosaic.ca/" style="line-height: 20px;">Mosaic</a>. Sometimes people interview me about things like [my job](https://www.tag1consulting.com/blog/inside-united-nations-office-coordination-humanitarian-affairs-un-ocha-emma-jane-hogbin), [source control](https://www.allthingsgit.com/episodes/git_for_teams_with_emma_jane_hogbin_westby.html), or [the cross-over between my craft and tech worlds](https://blog.axosoft.com/2016/06/09/emma-jane-westby/). You can also get a [behind-the-scenes on why I teach tech the way I do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYhHi8yK-Is), or hear me talk about my lack of [empathy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muZcqO1gGSg) (in under six minutes).

On-line I've gained popularity for: <a href="http://flickr.com/search/?q=drupal%20socks">knitting the drupal socks</a>, and have taught in-person workshops across Canada on knitting, crochet, and bookbinding.

For a more complete bio you can <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Jane_Hogbin">read about me on Wikipedia</a> where information about me is maintained as part of the biography project.
