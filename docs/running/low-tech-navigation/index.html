			<p>When visiting a new place, whether it&rsquo;s in your own neighbourhood or further afield, there can be a moment&rsquo;s hesitation each time you turn. That hesitation may be the excitement or anticipation of finding something new, or it might be the fear of not knowing if you&rsquo;ll be able to make it back to where you started. A few tips for keeping track of where you&rsquo;re going without the aid of digital technology.</p>
<h1 id="use-a-paper-map">Use a paper map</h1>
<p>From basic tourist maps to your own hand-drawn (or even annotated maps), a map can be an indespensible tool. Yes, it may identify you clearly as a tourist, which can put you slightly more at risk in some urban environments. You may find that you don&rsquo;t need a huge fold out map though to give you the basics of where you&rsquo;re headed.</p>
<h1 id="prepare-turn-by-turn-instructions">Prepare turn-by-turn instructions</h1>
<p>Along the same lines as the paper map: you might also want to write out turn-by-turn directions for your route. It won&rsquo;t help you with context, and won&rsquo;t be a lot of help if you get off-course, but it&rsquo;s still a handy way to make sure you don&rsquo;t need to memorise every last detail. By using Google view ahead of time you could also write a note about what is interesting about the corner (to ensure you don&rsquo;t miss a turn if there isn&rsquo;t an obvious road sign).</p>
<h1 id="mark-points-of-interest-with-chalk">Mark points of interest with chalk</h1>
<p>The back lanes all look the same to me. They&rsquo;re all a variation of a hedgerow, paved road, and a gate leading into a field. To make them unique when I&rsquo;m attempting an out-and-back route, I can add a chalk mark. This might be something as simple as a circle, or a smiley face, or it could be more informative and also include the direction of travel. If you&rsquo;re including the direction of travel try to have a convention of whether you mark the way you <em>should</em> go on your return trip, or the way you <em>came from</em>. It doesn&rsquo;t really matter because that chalk mark on its own should be enough to help remind you what to do next.</p>
<h1 id="travel-a-loop-in-both-directions">Travel a loop in both directions</h1>
<p>When running we tend to look forwards, not backwards. If you feel comfortable on an out-and-back trip, you may find you can also link together these out and back trips into longer loops. for example: I might run out and back for the first third of a longer loop I want to attempt. As I get more familiar with this route I will have learned what it looks like from two directions. Next I might run the last third of the loop as an out-and-back run. Repeat this a few times and I know what more than half of the route looks like from two directions. The next step is to link up the middle bit. I should recognise the last third of the route when I get to it because I will have seen it from the direction I&rsquo;m already headed.</p>
