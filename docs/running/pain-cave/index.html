			<p>A basic internet search will uncover more than a few articles on The Pain Cave. Since I started running more seriously a few years ago I&rsquo;ve become a little obssed with trying to understand how I could love my own pain cave. I had this idea that if I could just love the pain a little more, maybe I could be a better athlete, able to push a little harder, and achieve a little more.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve now had two experiences that make me question whether I&rsquo;ve been looking for the right thing all this time. When I read about the pain cave it seemed like there some kind of alignment where you would experience a very bad hurt and then somehow break through that hurt. It has not (yet?) worked quite like this for me.</p>
<p>My first experience of the pain cave was after a very long day. I was tired, and cold and wrapped up in bed shivering and feeling pretty darn sorry for myself. Suddenly, there was a little flick of a switch in my brain and I felt like my brain had become a Russian nesting doll, with upset and hurt on the outside, but an observational peace on the inside. I can perhaps best describe it with this gif:</p>
<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/3o72FieLG07hheBu0M/giphy.gif" alt="John Travolta looking around"></p>
<p>I was there. But also somehow not there. I didn&rsquo;t stop being upset, but it also didn&rsquo;t bother me that I was upset.</p>
<p>Skip ahead a few months to my run during Storm Dennis. I&rsquo;m in the middle of a looped run with no easy escape. I&rsquo;m cold, wet, and my arms get a shooting nerve pain any time I slip and need to move them quickly. I am, shall we say, &ldquo;not in a good way&rdquo;. But I&rsquo;m also not unhappy. I&rsquo;m miserable, yes. But somehow my thoughts aren&rsquo;t aligning with my feelings. My face is screwed up. I&rsquo;m on the verge of ugly tears. And also thinking to myself &ldquo;this. right now. is me training for miles 60-70 of an ultra marathan. I am a freaking badass.&rdquo; I wasn&rsquo;t trying to trick myself into having fun, I simply was.</p>
<p>Up on the hill two things happened to me: I allowed myself to <em>experience</em> my emotions without guilt or shame, AND I allowed myself to proceed with the task at hand without the emotion altering my behaviour. In other words: I was upset AND I continued with the task of moving forward. I suppose it&rsquo;s a little like the improv &ldquo;<a href="https://www.dramanotebook.com/drama-games/yes-and/">yes, And!</a>&rdquo; game.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure 100% why I&rsquo;ve started to have these incredible experiences, but I&rsquo;ll chalk it up to a few different things: I&rsquo;m physically a lot stronger than I used to be, which means I have a lot more trust in my ability to progress through discomfort. The discomfort that I experienced on that run was weather-related: I had absolutely no control over it, and knew my only option was to get OUT of the weather. (I still have a hard time overcoming pain that is breathing-related as it feels too close to the panic attacks I used to suffer from regularly. This makes tempo runs, where you hang out on the edge of your lactate threshold for as long as possible, feel &ldquo;out of reach&rdquo;.) I&rsquo;ve also been using <a href="https://www.headspace.com/">Headspace</a> for several months. The <a href="https://www.headspace.com/meditation/happiness">Happiness Pack</a> and the <a href="https://www.headspace.com/meditation/focus">Focus Pack</a> were particularly useful.</p>
