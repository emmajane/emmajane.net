      <description>When visiting a new place, whether it&amp;rsquo;s in your own neighbourhood or further afield, there can be a moment&amp;rsquo;s hesitation each time you turn. That hesitation may be the excitement or anticipation of finding something new, or it might be the fear of not knowing if you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to make it back to where you started. A few tips for keeping track of where you&amp;rsquo;re going without the aid of digital technology.</description>

      <description>In 2014 I released a set of videos with O&amp;rsquo;Reilly: Collaborating with Git. The companion book, Git for Teams, was released September 2015 and is a best seller. My previous books (Drupal User&amp;rsquo;s Guide; and Front End Drupal) and videos (Drupal Fundamentals) were published with Prentice Hall.
With contributions in Jono Bacon&amp;rsquo;s Linux Desktop Hacks, Earl and Lynette Miles&amp;rsquo; Drupal&amp;rsquo;s Building Blocks, and Shannon Okey&amp;rsquo;s knitting pattern book Alt Fiber, you might say I have a rather diverse (but technical) set of interests.</description>

      <description>A basic internet search will uncover more than a few articles on The Pain Cave. Since I started running more seriously a few years ago I&amp;rsquo;ve become a little obssed with trying to understand how I could love my own pain cave. I had this idea that if I could just love the pain a little more, maybe I could be a better athlete, able to push a little harder, and achieve a little more.</description>
